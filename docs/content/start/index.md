This guide is for software development teams that are planning to build a decentralized application (dapp) on the Flow blockchain. The goal of this guide is to help you make key decisions that will affect the scope and structure of your dapp before you start your implementation.

This document assumes that you have a basic understanding of general blockchain systems, including smart contracts, public-key cryptography, accounts, and transactions.

The following sections will cover:

- The structure of a dapp on Flow
- How users interact with your dapp
- How to implement user payments
- Recommended patterns for smart contract design
