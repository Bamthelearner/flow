### Where will users receive their staking reward for each staking option?

If you staked using Flow Port, then you should be able to see your staking rewards there. You can also withdraw the rewards or manually re-stake them through Flow Port.

If you staked using a staking provider such as Kraken, Blocto or Finoa, they should be able to provide you with more details on how to receive the staking reward.

### Will staking rewards be automatically re-staked?

There will be *no* automatic re-staking of staking rewards with Flow Port (i.e. using Ledger or Blocto).

If you staked using a staking provider such as Kraken, Blocto or Finoa, they should be able to provide you with more details.

### Can a validator change its fees?

For the beta period weâ€™re enforcing a minimum delegation fee of 8% which cannot be changed.

### Can a token holder stake to multiple nodes? If yes, how is the stake split between them?

A token holder will be able to stake multiple nodes in the future.
However, currently there is a restriction in place from the token lockup rules such that there is a 1-to-1 relationship between an account address and an active stake.
We have the same restriction in place for an account address and an active delegation.
This means that 1 account address can have at maximum 1 active stake and 1 active delegation at any given time.
If a token holder wants to have additional stake and/or delegate transactions, then they must create additional account addresses to do so.

### Is there a utility to generate the generate the FLOW addresses?

Staking or delegation of FLOW has to be done via Flow port which requires a login through Ledger or Blocto.
Hence, a utility cannot be used to generate a Flow address since it cannot be used to stake or delegate via Flow port.

### Is the wallet key transferred to the staked or delegated node?

No- The keys on the node are different from the wallet keys. The wallet keys always stay in the wallet.
A node operator generates the staking and networking keys separately which will be used on the node.

### Can I stake through multiple accounts to meet the minimum FLOW required for staking a node?

No, the minimum staking FLOW should come from a single account for all node type except for the consensus node.
The minimum for consensus nodes can cumulatively come from a combination a staking account and a delegation account.

### How can I reach the Consensus node minimum stake of 500K FLOW

The consensus node min 500K FLOW can be reached cumulatively with any combination of a lease and delegation. e.g. lease 250K and then delegate the remaining 250K.

### Is rewards payout another spork?

No, rewards payout is not a spork but (currently) a separate transaction that we initiate.

### Are leased tokens technically owned by the recipient or are they still considered leased after being staked?

DapperLabs has possession of the private keys for the account where the leased tokens are held, so technically DapperLabs has ownership of them.
The recipient of the leased tokens however has the ability to stake them for their nodes, but don't have the ability to withdraw them or do anything else with them.

### How long will tokens be leased to us?

1 year with the opportunity to extend to 2 years
