# Rewards

Rewards are paid out at the end of each epoch, approximately weekly, to all the users that have tokens staked.
Once distributed, rewards are considered to be unlocked and liquid, so they can be transferred any time. 
Some custody providers might require extra steps to withdraw user staking reward 
so please contact your respective provider to get additional information as needed. 

## Rewards Distribution

The rewards distribution schedule has been designed to ensure there is enough liquid supply of FLOW
available in the ecosystem to empower a wide variety of use cases and, while promoting a fair
and diverse participation in the Flow ecosystem.

The numbers in this table represent the total amount of tokens that are paid as staking rewards 
at each epoch to the entire pool of participants in the Flow network as a whole.
While total staking reward per epoch is known and fixed, individual reward is variable depending on many
factors. Please see next section on how to calculate individual staking reward.

|                                | Epoch* 1         | Epochs 2-6  | Epochs 7 - 52  | Epochs 53+  |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Total Rewards % (Annual)       | 5%             | 20%        | 5%            | TBD        |
| Total Rewards Amount Per Week  | 1,173,391 FLOW | ~4.4M FLOW/epoch | ~1.2M FLOW/epoch    | TBD        |

* Epochs are a week long period over which stake is fixed and at the end of which rewards are paid out to those who were staked/delegated during that epoch. 

## Individual Calculation

Each user gets a percentage of the total rewards during each epoch that is proportional to 
their percentage of all the tokens that are staked by all participants.	

The full reward calculation on a per user basis is equal to:	

```	
New Reward(user) = Tr  * (Sn / St)	
```	

where:	
- `Tr` = Total staking rewards to be paid out during current epoch. (e.g., 1.17M FLOW for the first epoch, per above table)	
- `Sn` = Amount of FLOW Staked by the target user (or yourself) for the current Epoch. (Different for each individuals staking or delegation amount)
- `St` = Sum of all the FLOW staked by all the participants in the network.	 (Changes based on the amount of all FLOW staked in the ecosystem)

Rewards for delegators are also calculated in the exact same way 	
that rewards for node operators are calculated, 	
with one difference in that 8% of the calculated staking reward amount 	
is given to the node operator being delegated to (protocol layer fee, same for all node operators). 	
The remaining 92% is awarded to the delegator. Note: the 8% fee is only applied to staking reward,
not to the total amount of token delegated.

With this calculation, the node you choose to run or delegate to DOES NOT
affect the amount of rewards you receive every week. The only variable that you can control
is the number of tokens you have staked. 

Because of the variable nature of the rewards calucation, we cannot provide an expected
weekly/yearly return for a single staker. You can plug your own numbers into the formula
to see some sample calculations, but you won't be able to know exactly what you will earn
until the beginning of the epoch where you expect to receive rewards.
