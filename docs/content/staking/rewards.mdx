description: How the Flow protocol pays rewards to stakers

## Rewards

Rewards are paid out at the end of each [epoch](/staking/#epochs) to all the users that have tokens staked.
Rewards are considered to be unlocked and liquid, so the user can withdraw their rewards
at any time.

More information about the rewards calculation and schedule will be provided in the near future.

If you staked using a 3rd party staking provider such as Kraken, Blocto or Finoa, please read [our guides](/staking/custody-providers/) for more information about how
to claim and use your rewards via your chosen provider.

## Rewards Distribution

The rewards distribution schedule has been designed to ensure that enough liquid FLOW
is available in the ecosystem to a wide variety of holders after the first few reward payments.
Using this model, any user will be able to easily aquire FLOW from many different places
in order to participate in the network.

The numbers in this table represent the total tokens that are paid as rewards each epoch.
They are not meant to indicate any expectations for an individual staker's rewards.
Different variables go into calculating what an individual staker receives as rewards.
