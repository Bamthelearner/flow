title: Flow Bi-Weekly Wave
---

Hey folks, 

Itâ€™s been a busy sprint for the Flow team! Thank you to everyone who has applied to become a Node Operator, contributed to the Coinlist sale, and started building on Flow - we wouldnâ€™t be where we are without your support.

Without further adieu, hereâ€™s your latest Flow update!

H3[Executive Summary]

## Available Now

- [NBA Top Shot Open Beta Launch!](https://www.nbatopshot.com/)Thereâ€™s another pack drop on October 5th, so donâ€™t miss out
- The contracts and transaction templates needed to support staking are now available and ready for you to integrate with. The team is going to be extra diligent responding to Discord questions in the coming weeks to ensure you arenâ€™t blocked and have everything you need to, including: 
  â‹…â‹…* Locked Token Account - this is the account youâ€™ll be creating to support the holding of / interaction with locked FLOW tokens. It creates a token admin capability inside the co-managed account. To learn more about the dual account model to supporting locked tokens, please read our documentation here. 
  â‹…â‹…* Locked Token Contract - this is the contract youâ€™ll be sending <insert type> transactions to. You will not deploy this contract, you will only interact with it via the following transaction templates:
  â‹…â‹…â‹…* <insert supported actions on locked token contract - answer, what is this for?>

  â‹…â‹…* Core Staking & Staking Proxy Contract (for Staking Helper) - this is the contract youâ€™ll submit staking requests to. You will only need to deploy a staking proxy contract if youâ€™re supporting staking-as-service models. The transactions needed for interacting with both of these contracts include:
â‹…â‹…â‹…* Staking request
â‹…â‹…â‹…* Unstaking request
â‹…â‹…â‹…* Delegating request
â‹…â‹…â‹…* Reward request (where do these go actually?) 
 â‹…â‹…* Delegation support - you get delegation support for free when you integrate with the core staking contract. The Flow Service Account exposes a list of node operators valid for each epoch, which is enforced by the core staking contract, and populated via the `valid staking references <insert real name for the thing that says you can delegate to a node>` exposed by individual node operators.
