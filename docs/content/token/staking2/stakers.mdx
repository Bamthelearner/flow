<Callout type="warning">

  This guide is for developers who wish to stake FLOW with the help of a **node operator**. 
  If you wish to operate your own node, please read the [power user guide](/token/staking2/power-users).

# Introduction

This guide covers the technical integration required for a **token holder (TH)** and **node operator (NO)** 
to jointly fund and operate a staked Flow node.

Both parties have separate roles in this relationship:

- **Node Operator:** Manages the node infrastructure but _does not hold_ any FLOW tokens.
- **Token Holder:** Provides restricted, indirect access to their FLOW tokens for the sole purpose of staking.

This guide assumes that the **token holder** has already estabilished a relationship with a trusted **node operator**.

# Setup

These are the steps required to set up the integration between a **token holder** and a **node operator**.

## 1. Fetch Node Operator information

TODO
- Provide `operatorAddress, nodeID`
- Uses `getOperatorNodeInfo` script

## 2. Submit a staking request

TODO
- Provide `amount` to be staked
- Provide `operatorAddress, nodeID` to stake
- Uses `registerNode` transaction

## 3. Grant staking access to the Node Operator

TODO
- Uses `addStakingProxy` transaction

# Staking Actions

## Stake New Tokens

TODO
- Uses `stakeNewLockedTokens`

## Stake Unbonded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `stakeLockedUnbondedTokens`

## Stake Rewarded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `stakeLockedRewardedTokens`

## Unstake Tokens

TODO
- Uses `unstakeLockedTokens`

## Withdraw Unbonded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `withdrawLockedUnbondedTokens`

## Withdraw Rewarded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `withdrawLockedRewardedTokens`
