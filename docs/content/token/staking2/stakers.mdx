<Callout type="warning">

  This guide is for developers who wish to stake FLOW with the help of a **node operator**. 
  If you wish to operate your own node, please read the [power user guide](/token/staking2/power-users).

# Introduction

This guide covers the technical integration required for a **token holder (TH)** and **node operator (NO)** 
to jointly fund and operate a staked Flow node.

Both parties have separate roles in this relationship:

- **Node Operator:** Manages the node infrastructure but _does not hold_ any FLOW tokens.
- **Token Holder:** Provides restricted, indirect access to their FLOW tokens for the sole purpose of staking.

This guide assumes that the **token holder** has already established a 
trusted relationship with a **node operator**.

# Setup

These are the steps required to set up the integration between a **token holder** and a **node operator**.

_Note: The corresponding **node operator** steps are outlined in a 
[separate guide for node operators](/token/staking2/node-operators)._

## 1. Fetch node operator information

TODO
- Provide `operatorAddress, nodeID`
- Uses `TH.04` script

## 2. Register node & grant staking access to the node operator

TODO
- Provide `amount` to be staked
- Provide `operatorAddress, nodeID` to stake to
- Uses `TH.05` transaction

# Staking Actions

## Stake New Tokens

TODO
- Uses `TH.06` transaction

## Stake Unbonded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `TH.07` transaction

## Stake Rewarded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `TH.08` transaction

## Unstake Tokens

TODO
- Uses `TH.09` transaction

## Withdraw Unbonded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `TH.10` transaction

## Withdraw Rewarded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `TH.11` transaction
