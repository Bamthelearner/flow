## Introduction

Flow users can stake their tokens and run nodes in a variety of ways. 
Please select the option that best matches your use case.

1. [For Stakers](): I have **FLOW tokens** and I want to run a node with help from a **node operator**.
1. [For Delegators](): I have **FLOW tokens** and I want to **delegate my tokens** to another node.
1. [For Power Users](): I have **FLOW tokens** and I want to run **my own staked node**.
1. [For Node Operators](): I am a **node operator** and I want to help others run nodes.
