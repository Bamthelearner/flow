title: How to be a Flow Node Operator
sidebar_title: For Node Operators

# Introduction

This guide covers the technical integration required for a **node operator (NO)** to operate
a staked Flow node using locked FLOW provided by a **token holder (TH)**.

Both parties have separate roles in this relationship:

- **Node Operator:** Manages the node infrastructure but _does not hold_ any FLOW tokens.
- **Token Holder:** Provides restricted, indirect access to their FLOW tokens for the sole purpose of staking.

This guide assumes that the **node operator** has already established a 
trusted relationship with a **token holder**.

# Setup

These are the steps taken by a **node operator** to set up the integration with a **token holder**.

_Note: The corresponding **token holder** steps are outlined in a 
[separate guide for token holders](/token/staking2/stakers)._

## 1. Create a node operator account

This step can be skipped if the **node operator** already has an account.

TODO:
- Uses `createOperatorAccount` transaction (`NO.01`)

## 2. Create a new `NodeInfo` entry

TODO:
- Uses `addNodeInfo` transaction (`NO.02`)

## 3. Confirm staking access with token holder

After the `NodeInfo` object has been created and published, 
the **token holder** uses it to initiate a staking request. 
After this, the **token holder** passes a `StakingProxy.NodeStakerProxy`
capability to the **node operator** that allows them to perform staking operations.

The **node operator** should confirm that they have access to this capability.

# Staking Actions

## Stake New Tokens

TODO
- Uses `stakeNewLockedTokens`

## Stake Unbonded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `stakeLockedUnbondedTokens`

## Unstake Tokens

TODO
- Uses `unstakeLockedTokens`

## Withdraw Unbonded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `withdrawLockedUnbondedTokens`

## Withdraw Rewarded Tokens

TODO
- Uses `withdrawLockedRewardedTokens`

# Teardown

## Remove `NodeInfo` entry

The **node operator** can destroy the `NodeInfo` entry after 
the staking relationship has concluded.

TODO
- Uses `removeNodeInfo` transaction (`NO.03`)
