### Are FLOW token holders obligated to run nodes? If yes, for how long?

FLOW token holders are not required to run nodes but we imagine that most will opt either to run nodes or to stake their FLOW tokens on nodes via a proxy in order to earn staking rewards for the foreseeable future.

### Can FLOW token holders stake their full FLOW balance or only the unlocked balance?

Flow Token Holders have their full FLOW balance available to stake. The unlocked balance is the amount they can transfer, not the amount they can stake.

### When will FLOW tokens be tradable?

Flow tokens from the CoinList sale have a one year lockup period. They cannot be traded but they can still be staked during that time. There's more info here:

 https://coinlist.co/flow


Auction tokens will also be locked and stakeable for one year.

### What Is The Lockup Period?

Our investors' tokens are allowed to be liquidated straight line over 24 months - all those tokens are available to stake and earn rewards on day one, but the principal can't be unlocked until the longer of the unbonding period and the lock-up period for that portion of tokens.

### What Is The Unbonding Period?

The unbonding period is the time that you have to wait for your previously staked FLOW tokens to be unstaked. Currently this is approximately one week.

### How much will CoinList charge for storage and staking FLOW tokens?

There will be zero fees for storing your FLOW tokens with CoinList. They want to charge 10% of the staking rewards only. Stay tuned for final numbers here, but your actual tokens are 100% yours. Also most of that fee goes directly to the operator of the node to pay for the hardware and electricity costs â€“ CoinList doesn't actually keep it.

### How much will CoinList charge for storage and staking FLOW tokens?

No, each address is meant to map to only one CoinList account. We will enforce this mapping when FLOW tokens are transferred from CoinList.

### Can I have access to my private keys in a CoinList wallet?

You have access to your unlocked account private key and to your multisig locked account key, but not to the admin key for the locked account that is needed to unlock FLOW tokens over time.

### Will I have full control of my assets?

You can stake both locked and unlocked FLOW tokens immediately but you can only transfer FLOW tokens that the admin key unlocks over time.

### Can I pool my FLOW tokens with other token holders in order to have the minimum stake required to run a node?

Not right now, but we hope that you will be able to do this in the future.
You can already use proxy staking to stake your FLOW tokens with other token holders using an existing node.
